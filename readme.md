# Selection Phobia App (iOS & Android)
Repository for the mobile app portion of the Selection Phobia web application. 

## Overview the Project
Selection Phobia is a social networking site that helps people with indecisive tendencies to decide. This process is done by an anonymous voting system where users can write a question and provide a few options for our community members to vote on. Other uses can then vote on which option the asker should do/decide on, thus giving the asker a good consensus on what other people would do in their shoes.
